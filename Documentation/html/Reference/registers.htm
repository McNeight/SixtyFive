  N = NEGATIVE. Reflects the state of bit 7 after an operation. Used to indicate 
  negative values.<br>
  <br>
  V = OVERFLOW. The overflow flag is set during arithmetic operations if the result 
  has yielded an invalid 2's complement result (e.g. adding to positive numbers 
  and ending up with a negative result: 64 + 64 =&gt; -128). It is determined 
  by looking at the carry between bits 6 and 7 and between bit 7 and the carry 
  flag.<br>
  <br>
  B = BRK COMMAND. Set to 1 if an IRQ is caused by a BRK, reset to 0 if caused 
  by an external IRQ.<br>
  <br>
  D = DECIMAL MODE. Set to 1 to enable decimal math mode..<br>
  <br>
  I = IRQ DISABLE. Set to 1 to disable IRQ interrupt.<br>
  <br>
  Z = ZERO. Set to 1 if the result of the last operation was zero.<br>
  <br>
  C = CARRY. Set if an add produced a value larger then 255, or if the subtraction<br>
  produced a borrow. Also used during logical shifts.<br>
