<p>An address break will cause execution to stop when the instruction at the break 
  address is read. </p>

  to add the address break<br>

  Delete to delete it.<br>

  <strong>Enable</strong> - Click this to enable address breaks. </p>

  address. If not data is specified from a data break then only the read or write 
  is checked for, not the actual value.</p>

  box, the data (if any) in the Data box, select Read or Write, and click Add.<br>
