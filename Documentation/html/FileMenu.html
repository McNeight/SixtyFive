<blockquote>
  <p> Used to load a binary file into memory. In the file dialog box, select the 
    file you want to load, and the type of the file. 6502Sim supports the following 
    file type:</p>
  <p><strong>Raw Binary - </strong>A file containing raw binary data with no header. 
    If you select this type you will be prompted for the address where you want 
    to start loading the file. Enter this address in hex.</p>
  <p><strong>Org Binary</strong> - This is similar to the Raw Binary format, except 
    that the file begins with a two byte starting address in LSB/MSB format. </p>
  <p><strong>RAS Binary (Random Access Segment) -</strong> The file contains one 
    or more chunks of data. Each chunk starts with a 2 byte origin (LSB/MSB) a 
    2 byte length (LSB/MSB), and that number of data bytes. <br>
